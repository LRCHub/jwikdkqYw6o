How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?

We've kicked it for a little while you know
I think it's time for us to start to move ahead
We both been patient and that's cool and all
But I'm in need and you don't seem to even care

We've been in slow mo, never swung an episode
So what's the man to do, stay or go cheat on you?
Tell me baby, what are you so scared of?
I'll be real gentle when I'm making love to you

How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?

There ain't a thing you can't get from me
Whether it's ice, money, come what may
I did everything that you asked of me
You must simply, do not feel the same way

How longer do you need?
Can't you easily see that I'm the one for you, tell me what should I do?
Whoever hurt you made it rough for me
But you are you, I am me, he was he

How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?

This love can't go unspoken
You got me wishing, hoping
You must let your judge lout
We've been through it all before now

This time we make that move now
Someplace, somewhere and somehow
Let's not play, not your games
Don't live, die, don't live die, we're too grown

How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?

How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?

How deep is your love girl, let's get serious
How deep is your love girl, I'm so curious
How deep is your love girl, can I fall in it?
How deep is your love, can I get close to it?
