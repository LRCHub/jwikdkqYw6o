I know your eyes in the morning sun
I feel you touch me in the pouring rain
And the moment that you wonder far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
Then youe to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
Youre the light in my deepest darkest hour
Youre my saviour when I fall
And you may not think I care of you
When you know down inside that I really do
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

And the moment that you wonder far from me
I wanna feel you in my arms again
Then youe to me on a summer breeze
Keep me warm in your love
Then you softly leave
And its me you need to show
How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me

How deep is your love
I really mean to learn
Cause were living in a world of fools
Breaking us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
